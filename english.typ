    == Work Experience

    #experience("images/britishredcross.jpg")[Resilience Engineer][British Red Cross][2024-09 --- present][WFH]

    I improve reliability and observability across Azure and third-party
    systems. I build end-to-end visibility with health, log, and synthetic
    monitoring to surface risks early and cut incident impact.

    I design lightweight checks and automation that validate resilience in
    complex environments. I help set standards and frameworks so teams share
    clear signals, detect faults faster, and run more stable services.

    I partner with stakeholders to map critical user journeys and define
    SLOs, aligning monitoring and alerting to outcomes.

    #experience("images/ovoenergy.png")[Senior Solutions Engineer][OVO Energy][2022 --- 2024-09][Bristol, UK]

    I led the design and delivery of scalable, resilient systems that raised
    performance and reliability for core platforms. I focused on automation
    and integration to reduce operational risk while supporting growth.

    I worked with engineering and operations to ship practical solutions that
    strengthened stability and streamlined delivery. The result was more
    consistent and dependable service outcomes.

    #experience("images/ovoenergy.png")[Process Improvement Specialist][OVO Energy][2021 --- 2022][Bristol, UK]

    I advanced IT processes by streamlining operations and improving system
    reliability. I wrote code, refined deployments, and automated routine
    workflows to cut manual effort and errors.

    Through analysis and optimisation I increased team agility and uptime.
    This strengthened the stability and efficiency of the environment.

    == Education

    #experience("images/uwe.png")[BA International Relations (First Class Honours)][University of the West of England][2007 --- 2010][Bristol, UK]

    Earned a degree in International Relations, gaining skills in analysis,
    negotiation, and cross-cultural communication. This foundation enriches
    my approach to problem-solving and team collaboration in any setting.
